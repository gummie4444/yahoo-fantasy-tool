[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

> Your One-Stop solution for a full-stack app with ES6/ES2015 React.js featuring universal Redux, React Router, React Router Redux Hot reloading, CSS modules, Express 4.x, (forked from reactGo)
#### Demo site: [**https://godda-photo.herokuapp.com/**](https://gudda-photo.herokuapp.com/)

## Features:
- ~~isomorphic~~ [**universal**](https://medium.com/@ghengeveld/isomorphism-vs-universal-javascript-4b47fb481beb#.4x2t3jlmx) Rendering
- [**Redux**](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) Predictive state containers.
- Server-side rendering with [**React Router**](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) 2.x. Having server-side rendering allows you to pre-render the initial state of your components when a user (or search engine crawler) requests a page.
- Integrating Redux with React Router with ~~Redux Simple Router~~ [React Router Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux)
- Asynchronous Data Fetching on server-side rendering
- Server side authentication + Redirecting for components
- Hot reloading using [**react-transform-hmr**](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr)
- Time travel using [**Redux-Devtools Chrome Extension**](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension)
- [**Webpack 2**](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) for both development and production bundles. It's (in my opinion) the best bundler for JS, CSS, LESS, images, and lots more!
- [**CSS Modules**](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) allows for modular and reusable CSS. Say goodbye to conflicts (most of them) and global scope

- **Unit Testing** with webpack, karma, jsdom, mocha, sinon & enzyme
	- Reducers
	- Components ([Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme))
	- Synchronous and Asynchronous Actions

- Express 4.x server with a ton of middleware
- Mongoose for MongoDB
- Sequelize for Postgres
- Procfile to enable deployment to Heroku & Docs on Salt configurations + Deployment for Digital Ocean

#### Data Flow

A simplistic representation of data flow from server to client is:

```
Express app.use() receives a request
-> Calls a pre-built webpack file for the server
-> Runs matching of routes in react-router for server
-> Makes async data fetching request
-> Renders Route component to string
-> Construct HTML file (with Meta, Link tags using helmet)
-> Browser receives html file with initial state
-> Client side React.JS kicks in and initializes with given state
-> Continues where it left off
-> Everyone is happy :)
```

#### Redux DevTools

You will have to install redux devtools extension from [here](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) and then everything should just work!

## Instructions

#### Database

We currently support MongoDB and Postgres, as well as the ability to not use any database. [Learn](docs/databases.md) about how to configure your app.

#### Unit Tests

Testing with:
- `karma` as test runner
	- `karma.conf.js` for the main karma configuration (it has webpack configurations)
	- `tests.webpack.js` which is the single entry file. It uses `webpack`'s require API to find all the files we need that have a `-test.js` suffix.
- `mocha` as the test framework
- `jsdom` as my test environment

```bash
# Run test once
npm test

# Run in watch mode
npm test:watch
```

We have unit tests for async (redux) actions, reducers, and stateless components with [enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme).

#### Deployment

Currently we support [Heroku](docs/deployment/Heroku.md) and [Digital Ocean](docs/deployment/DigitalOcean.md) and [AWS](docs/deployment/AWS.md)
